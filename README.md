## Abstract

Urban road crashes claim over 1.19 million lives annually and injure 20–50 million more worldwide, with low- and middle-income countries bearing 90% of this burden despite owning only 60% of global vehicles. Traditional manual enforcement systems cannot scale to modern traffic volumes, introducing issues of coverage gaps, inconsistency, and human fatigue. This paper presents a scalable, Dockerized microservices-based traffic violation detection system that processes live CCTV feeds to detect three critical violations—signal-line crossing, illegal parking, and wrong-way driving—in real-time with minimal infrastructure requirements. Our pipeline integrates OpenCV preprocessing, a transfer-learned MobileNet v1 classifier (94% accuracy), and rule-based violation logic, achieving an overall F₁-score of 0.91 across all violation types with end-to-end latency under 150 ms (≈15 FPS). We further provide a comprehensive PyQt5 GUI for real-time monitoring, alert management, and violation record administration. All events persist in a BCNF-normalized SQLite database supporting auditing, analytics, and integration with external systems. Extensive evaluation under varying environmental conditions demonstrates the system's robustness and readiness for real-world smart city deployments, aligning with UN Sustainable Development Goals 9 and 11 for resilient, sustainable urban infrastructure.

## I. INTRODUCTION

Road crashes remain one of the most significant public health challenges globally, causing over 1.19 million fatalities and between 20-50 million injuries annually [1], [2]. These crashes disproportionately affect low- and middle-income countries, which suffer more than 90% of road traffic fatalities while possessing only about 60% of the world's vehicles. The economic impact is equally devastating, with road crashes costing most countries approximately 3% of their gross domestic product [1].

Traditional traffic enforcement systems rely heavily on human monitoring and intervention, leading to several critical limitations:

1) **Limited coverage**: Human officers cannot monitor all areas simultaneously
2) **Subjective enforcement**: Different interpretations of violations by different officers
3) **Temporal inconsistency**: Enforcement primarily during peak hours or specific shifts
4) **Resource intensity**: High personnel costs for comprehensive monitoring
5) **Human factors**: Fatigue, distraction, and potential for error or bias

Automated vision-based systems offer a compelling alternative by leveraging existing CCTV infrastructure to provide constant, objective monitoring at scale. Such systems align with smart city initiatives worldwide, which seek to employ technology to improve urban living conditions, sustainability, and safety.

This paper proposes a comprehensive architecture for real-time traffic violation detection focused on three critical violations that contribute significantly to accident rates:

1) **Signal Violation**: Vehicles crossing the designated stop line during red signal phases
2) **Parking Violation**: Vehicles remaining stationary in designated no-parking zones beyond acceptable thresholds
3) **Directional Violation**: Vehicles traveling against the permitted flow of traffic

Our research addresses the following key questions:
- How can multiple violation types be detected through a unified pipeline with high accuracy?
- What architectural choices enable real-time processing with minimal latency?
- How can the system remain robust against environmental variations?
- What interfaces best support traffic management personnel?

The primary contributions of this work include:

- A modular, Dockerized microservices pipeline supporting ingestion, preprocessing, detection/tracking, classification, violation logic, logging, and visualization components that can scale elastically
- A lightweight but high-accuracy vehicle classification approach using transfer-learned MobileNet v1 achieving 94% classification accuracy with only 20 ms inference time
- A comprehensive PyQt5 desktop graphical user interface providing real-time alerts, evidence views, search capabilities, and record management tools
- Rigorous quantitative evaluation including precision/recall/F₁-score metrics for each violation type and detailed end-to-end latency analysis
- Privacy-preserving design considerations including configurable anonymization, retention policies, and role-based access controls

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work in traffic violation detection; Section III details the system architecture and data model; Section IV presents our methodology for detection and classification; Section V describes the implementation and experimental results; Section VI addresses ethical and privacy considerations; Section VII discusses limitations and future work; and Section VIII concludes the paper.

## II. RELATED WORK

Traffic violation detection systems can be broadly categorized into sensor-based and vision-based approaches, each with distinct advantages and limitations. Table I presents a comparative analysis of existing solutions.

**TABLE I: COMPARISON OF EXISTING TRAFFIC VIOLATION DETECTION APPROACHES**

| Approach | Method | Violations Detected | Accuracy | Latency | Scalability | Visual Evidence | Ref. |
|----------|--------|---------------------|----------|---------|-------------|----------------|------|
| Sensor-based | RFID | Signal, Speed | 95% | <50ms | Low | No | [3] |
| Sensor-based | Inductive Loops | Signal, Speed | 92% | <30ms | Low | No | [3] |
| Vision-based | YOLOv3 + OpenCV | Signal | 88% | 200ms | Medium | Yes | [4] |
| Vision-based | DeepSort + YOLO | Parking, Signal | 90% | 180ms | Medium | Yes | [5] |
| Vision-based | Optical Flow + Kalman | Directional | 85% | 150ms | Medium | Yes | [6] |
| Vision-based | SSD | Signal, Speed | 91% | 160ms | Medium | Yes | [7] |
| Vision-based | YOLOv7 | Multiple | 93% | 140ms | High | Yes | [8] |

### A. Sensor-based Approaches

Sensor-based systems typically employ technologies such as RFID, inductive loops, or radar to detect vehicles and monitor their behavior. Patel and Kumar [3] demonstrate an RFID-based system where vehicles equipped with RFID tags are monitored for signal violations. While these approaches offer high accuracy and low latency, they present several limitations:

1) **Infrastructure requirements**: Necessitate dedicated hardware installation
2) **Tag compliance**: Vehicles must be equipped with appropriate sensors
3) **Limited violation types**: Primarily suited for signal and speed violations
4) **Evidence limitations**: Lack visual evidence for verification and prosecution

### B. Vision-based Approaches

Computer vision approaches have gained prominence due to their flexibility and ability to leverage existing CCTV infrastructure. Current research in this area includes:

1) **Object Detection Frameworks**: Sharma and Gupta [4] employ YOLOv3 with OpenCV for signal violation detection, achieving 88% accuracy but with relatively high latency (200ms). More recent approaches using YOLOv7 [8] have improved both accuracy and performance metrics.

2) **Tracking-based Systems**: Wang [5] combines DeepSort tracking with YOLO detection to maintain vehicle identity across frames, enabling parking violation detection. However, this approach struggles with occlusion and dense traffic scenarios.

3) **Motion Analysis**: Zhao and Li [6] utilize optical flow techniques and Kalman filtering to identify directional violations based on motion vectors. While computationally efficient, these methods demonstrate reduced accuracy in complex traffic patterns.

4) **Single-shot Detectors**: Verma and Singh [7] implement SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) for signal and speed violation detection, reporting high accuracy (91%) but limited user interface capabilities for operational deployment.

### C. Research Gaps

Despite significant advances, several gaps remain in current traffic violation detection research:

1) **Unified approach**: Most systems focus on specific violation types rather than providing a comprehensive solution
2) **Real-time performance**: Many systems sacrifice latency for accuracy, limiting deployment viability
3) **Operational interfaces**: Limited attention to user interfaces for traffic management personnel
4) **Scalability concerns**: Insufficient focus on architecture for large-scale deployment
5) **Privacy considerations**: Inadequate treatment of privacy and data protection requirements

Our work addresses these gaps by providing a unified approach to multiple violation types, maintaining real-time performance, designing comprehensive interfaces, employing a scalable microservices architecture, and incorporating robust privacy protections.

## III. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### A. Microservices Pipeline

Our system employs a modular microservices architecture (Fig. 1) that decouples functional components to enhance maintainability, scalability, and fault tolerance. Each component runs as an independent Docker container, communicating via REST APIs and message queues to ensure reliable data flow.

**Fig. 1. Microservices pipeline for real-time traffic violation detection**

```
CCTV Feed → Preprocessing Service → Detection & Tracking Service
→ Classification Service (MobileNet v1) → Violation Logic Service
→ Database Logger Service → PyQt5 GUI Application
```

The architecture consists of the following core components:

1) **Video Ingestion Service**: Captures and buffers live CCTV feeds, supporting various input formats (RTSP, HTTP, local files) with configurable frame rates
2) **Preprocessing Service**: Applies image enhancement techniques to normalize lighting conditions, reduce noise, and highlight motion
3) **Detection & Tracking Service**: Identifies moving objects and maintains consistent identity across frames
4) **Classification Service**: Categorizes detected objects as vehicle types or non-vehicles
5) **Violation Logic Service**: Implements rule-based algorithms to detect specific traffic violations
6) **Database Logger Service**: Persists violation events, evidence images, and metadata
7) **GUI Application**: Provides the user interface for monitoring, alert management, and record administration

This decoupled architecture offers several advantages:
- **Horizontal scalability**: Components can be replicated to handle increased camera feeds
- **Fault isolation**: Failures in one component do not cascade to others
- **Independent upgradeability**: Services can be updated individually without system-wide downtime
- **Resource optimization**: Computing resources can be allocated based on component needs

### B. Data Model

The system employs a BCNF-normalized relational database schema (Fig. 2) designed to support efficient querying, data integrity, and future extensibility. The core entities in our data model include:

**Fig. 2. Entity-relationship diagram showing relationships among Vehicles, Rules, Cameras, and Violations**

1) **Vehicles** (Vehicle_ID, Plate, Type, First_Sighted, Image_Path, Owner)
   - Stores information about identified vehicles
   - Optional owner information for integration with vehicle registration databases

2) **Rules** (Rule_ID, Description, Fine, Status, Last_Updated)
   - Defines violation types and associated penalties
   - Status field enables/disables specific rules without code changes
   - Supports dynamic addition of new rule types

3) **Cameras** (Camera_ID, Location, Coordinates, Feed_URL, Group, Status)
   - Manages information about camera deployments
   - Supports logical grouping for area-based monitoring
   - Status field indicates operational state

4) **Violations** (Violation_ID, Vehicle_ID, Rule_ID, Camera_ID, Timestamp, Evidence_Path, Status, Officer_ID)
   - Records individual violation events
   - Links to evidence images/videos
   - Supports workflow states (pending, verified, processed)
   - Optional officer attribution for manual verification

5) **Audit_Log** (Log_ID, Entity_Type, Entity_ID, Action, User_ID, Timestamp, Details)
   - Maintains comprehensive audit trail of all system interactions
   - Supports regulatory compliance and security analysis

The BCNF normalization ensures minimal redundancy while maintaining referential integrity across all relationships. The schema supports both real-time operational needs and historical analysis for traffic pattern research.

## IV. METHODOLOGY

### A. Preprocessing Pipeline

The preprocessing pipeline transforms raw video frames into a format optimized for vehicle detection and violation analysis through the following steps:

1) **Color Conversion**: Converts input frames from BGR to grayscale to reduce computational complexity:
   $$I_{gray}(x,y) = 0.299 \cdot R(x,y) + 0.587 \cdot G(x,y) + 0.114 \cdot B(x,y)$$

2) **Gaussian Blur**: Applies a 5×5 kernel to reduce noise and detail while preserving structural edges:
   $$I_{blur}(x,y) = \sum_{i=-2}^{2}\sum_{j=-2}^{2} I_{gray}(x+i,y+j) \cdot G(i,j)$$
   where $G(i,j)$ represents the Gaussian kernel.

3) **Background Subtraction**: Implements a mixture of Gaussians (MOG2) algorithm to identify moving objects:
   $$D_t(x,y) = \mathrm{saturate}\bigl(|F_t(x,y) - F_{t-1}(x,y)|\bigr)$$
   where $F_t$ and $F_{t-1}$ represent consecutive frames.

4) **Thresholding**: Applies adaptive thresholding to separate foreground objects:
   $$T(x,y) = \begin{cases}
   255, & \text{if } D_t(x,y) > \theta \\
   0, & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}$$
   where $\theta$ is determined dynamically based on frame characteristics.

5) **Morphological Operations**: Applies dilation to fill gaps within detected objects:
   $$M(x,y) = T(x,y) \oplus K$$
   where $K$ represents a 3×3 structuring element and $\oplus$ denotes the dilation operation.

6) **Contour Extraction**: Identifies and filters contours based on minimum area thresholds to reduce false positives.

This pipeline achieves an average preprocessing time of 45 ms per frame at 1080p resolution, with optimizations including concurrent processing of independent operations and frame downsampling for preliminary detection.

### B. Detection and Tracking

Vehicle detection and tracking maintain consistent identity across frames, enabling temporal analysis necessary for violation detection. Our approach combines:

1) **Contour-based Detection**: Extracts vehicle candidates from preprocessed frames using contour analysis:
   $$\text{Contours} = \{C_1, C_2, ..., C_n\}$$
   where each contour $C_i$ represents a potential vehicle.

2) **ROI Extraction**: Converts contours to bounding boxes for further processing:
   $$\text{ROI}_i = (x_i, y_i, w_i, h_i)$$
   where $(x_i, y_i)$ represents the top-left corner, and $(w_i, h_i)$ the width and height.

3) **Multi-object Tracking**: Implements IoU (Intersection over Union) based matching between frames:
   $$\text{IoU}(A, B) = \frac{\text{Area}(A \cap B)}{\text{Area}(A \cup B)}$$
   where $A$ and $B$ are bounding boxes from consecutive frames.

4) **Trajectory Maintenance**: For each tracked object, maintains position history:
   $$T_i = \{(x_1, y_1, t_1), (x_2, y_2, t_2), ..., (x_n, y_n, t_n)\}$$
   where $(x_j, y_j)$ represents the object centroid at time $t_j$.

5) **Kalman Filtering**: Applies predictive filtering to handle occlusions and detection gaps:
   $$\hat{x}_k = F \hat{x}_{k-1} + B u_k + w_k$$
   $$z_k = H \hat{x}_k + v_k$$
   where $\hat{x}_k$ is the state estimate, $F$ the state transition matrix, $z_k$ the measurement, and $w_k$, $v_k$ represent process and measurement noise respectively.

This tracking approach maintains vehicle identity with 93% accuracy across typical urban scenarios, with degradation primarily occurring during extended occlusions or in extremely dense traffic conditions.

### C. Vehicle Classification

Vehicle classification determines object type through a transfer-learned MobileNet v1 CNN architecture, chosen for its balance of accuracy and computational efficiency:

1) **Model Architecture**: MobileNet v1 employing depthwise separable convolutions to reduce parameters:
   $$G_{k,l,n} = \sum_i \sum_j \sum_m K_{i,j,m,n} \cdot F_{k+i-1, l+j-1, m}$$
   factorized into depthwise and pointwise convolutions.

2) **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuned from ImageNet weights using a custom dataset of 1,500 images across three categories:
   - Cars (sedans, SUVs, trucks): 600 images
   - Motorcycles (standard, sports, scooters): 400 images
   - Non-vehicles (pedestrians, animals, static objects): 500 images

3) **Data Augmentation**: Applied during training to enhance robustness:
   - Random horizontal flips (probability 0.5)
   - Random brightness adjustment (±20%)
   - Random contrast adjustment (±15%)
   - Random cropping (0.8-1.0 of original size)
   - Rotation (±15°)

4) **Optimization**: Trained using:
   - Optimizer: Adam ($\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.999$, $\epsilon=10^{-8}$)
   - Learning rate: 0.001 with decay factor 0.1 every 10 epochs
   - Batch size: 32
   - Epochs: 50 with early stopping (patience=7)

5) **Quantization**: Post-training quantization to enable efficient inference:
   - Weight precision reduced from 32-bit to 8-bit
   - Activation precision maintained at 8-bit

The resulting model achieves 94% classification accuracy with only 20 ms inference time per ROI on our test hardware, with TensorFlow Lite optimization enabling deployment on edge devices with limited computational resources.

### D. Violation Logic

Each violation type employs specialized detection logic combining spatial, temporal, and contextual analysis:

1) **Signal Violation Detection**:
   - Defines a virtual stop line for each monitored signal
   - Monitors signal state through a separate detector or API integration
   - Identifies violations when:
     $$\text{Violation} = \begin{cases}
     \text{True}, & \text{if } \text{SignalState} = \text{Red} \land \text{LineCrossed}(v_i) \\
     \text{False}, & \text{otherwise}
     \end{cases}$$
   where $\text{LineCrossed}(v_i)$ evaluates to true if vehicle $v_i$ crosses the stop line.

2) **Parking Violation Detection**:
   - Defines no-parking zones as polygon regions
   - Calculates stationary duration for vehicles within these regions:
     $$\text{StationaryTime}(v_i) = \begin{cases}
     t_{\text{current}} - t_{\text{stationary\_start}}, & \text{if } \text{IsStationary}(v_i) \\
     0, & \text{otherwise}
     \end{cases}$$
   - Flags violation when stationary time exceeds threshold:
     $$\text{Violation} = \text{StationaryTime}(v_i) > T_{\text{threshold}}$$
   where $T_{\text{threshold}}$ is configurable per zone (typically 30-120 seconds).

3) **Directional Violation Detection**:
   - Defines allowed direction vectors for each lane:
     $$\vec{D}_{\text{allowed}} = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$$
   - Calculates movement vector for each vehicle:
     $$\vec{v}_i = (x_{\text{current}} - x_{\text{previous}}, y_{\text{current}} - y_{\text{previous}})$$
   - Determines violation through vector alignment:
     $$\text{Violation} = \frac{\vec{v}_i \cdot \vec{D}_{\text{allowed}}}{|\vec{v}_i||\vec{D}_{\text{allowed}}|} < \cos(\theta_{\text{threshold}})$$
   where $\theta_{\text{threshold}}$ accommodates normal lane variations (typically 30°).

All violation logic includes configurable sensitivity parameters and verification mechanisms to minimize false positives, including minimum confidence thresholds, temporal consistency requirements, and spatial filtering.

These results demonstrate that each component contributes meaningfully to the system's overall performance, with Kalman filtering and transfer learning providing significant accuracy improvements while maintaining acceptable latency.

**4) Environmental Robustness**:

| Glare           | 0.83     | 144                 | 11.7                   |

The system demonstrates reasonable robustness across various conditions, with the most significant performance degradation occurring under glare conditions and in dense traffic scenarios.

### C. Core Algorithm Implementation

The heart of our system is the real-time violation detection algorithm, which processes each frame to identify vehicles and potential violations. Algorithm 1 presents the pseudocode for this core functionality:

**Algorithm 1: Real-Time Violation Detection**
```
Input: VideoStream
Output: ViolationEvents

1:  for each frame Ft in VideoStream do

These measures help ensure that the system operates within ethical boundaries while respecting individual privacy rights, an essential consideration for smart city technologies.

## VII. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

### A. System Limitations

While our system demonstrates strong performance across most scenarios, several limitations remain:

1) **Environmental Sensitivity**: Performance degradation of 5-12% in challenging conditions such as heavy rain, glare, and low light. Future work should explore specialized preprocessing for these conditions.

2) **Occlusion Handling**: Current tracking algorithms struggle with extended occlusions in dense traffic. Graph-based tracking approaches could improve performance in these scenarios.

3) **Specialized Vehicle Classes**: The current classification model may misclassify uncommon vehicle types such as construction equipment or oversized loads. Additional training data for these specialized categories would improve overall system robustness.

4) **Computational Requirements**: While the system operates in real-time on our test hardware, deployment on edge devices with limited processing power remains challenging without significant model compression.

5) **Multi-camera Correlation**: The current implementation treats each camera feed independently, missing opportunities to track vehicles across multiple viewpoints for improved accuracy.

### B. Deployment Considerations

Successful real-world deployment requires attention to several practical aspects:

1) **Infrastructure Integration**:
   - CCTV compatibility assessment and potential upgrades
   - Network bandwidth requirements (approximately 2-4 Mbps per camera)
   - Edge computing distribution strategies to minimize central processing
   - Backup power solutions for continuous operation

2) **Scalability Analysis**:
   - Horizontal scaling through containerization supports approximately 10-15 camera feeds per server instance
   - Kubernetes orchestration enables automatic scaling based on load
   - Database sharding strategies for deployments exceeding 100 cameras
   - Load testing confirms linear scaling up to 50 concurrent feeds

3) **Cost Analysis**:
   - Initial deployment: $1,500-2,500 per intersection (excluding cameras)
   - Annual maintenance: Approximately 15% of initial costs
   - ROI typically achieved within 8-14 months through:
     - Reduced personnel costs
     - Improved violation capture rates
     - Decreased accident-related expenses

4) **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - GDPR/CCPA data handling compliance
   - Alignment with local traffic enforcement regulations
   - Chain-of-custody maintenance for evidence admissibility
   - Regular compliance audits and reporting

### C. Future Research Directions

Based on our findings and identified limitations, we propose several promising directions for future research:

1) **Thermal/Infrared Integration**: Incorporating thermal imaging would significantly improve performance in low-light conditions and adverse weather, enabling 24/7 operation regardless of environmental conditions.

2) **Adaptive Background Models**: Developing scene-specific background models that automatically adjust to changing environmental conditions would enhance robustness against lighting variations, shadows, and precipitation.

3) **Deep Learning Alternatives**: Exploring EfficientDet and YOLOv8 architectures could provide improved accuracy while maintaining acceptable inference times, potentially eliminating the separate classification stage.

4) **Multi-camera Fusion**: Implementing methods for fusing information across multiple cameras would improve tracking continuity and violation detection accuracy, particularly in complex intersections.

5) **Behavioral Prediction**: Incorporating predictive models for vehicle behavior could enable proactive detection of potential violations before they occur, supporting preventative interventions.

6) **GUI-Driven Rule Management**: Developing interfaces for non-technical operators to define and modify violation detection rules would increase system flexibility and adoption.

7) **National Database Integration**: Creating secure APIs for integration with national vehicle registration and traffic enforcement databases would streamline the violation processing workflow.

8) **Federated Learning**: Implementing privacy-preserving federated learning approaches would enable model improvement across multiple deployments without compromising data security.

## VIII. CONCLUSION

This paper has presented a comprehensive real-time traffic violation detection system combining computer vision, IoT technologies, and cloud-native architecture to address critical road safety challenges. Through extensive evaluation, we have demonstrated that our approach achieves an overall F₁-score of 0.91 across three violation types (signal, parking, and directional), with end-to-end latency under 150 ms, enabling true real-time monitoring and alert generation.

The system's modular microservices architecture provides the flexibility and scalability required for smart city deployments, while the comprehensive PyQt5 GUI delivers the operational tools needed by traffic management personnel. Our careful attention to ethical considerations and privacy protection ensures that the system can be deployed responsibly, respecting individual rights while improving public safety.

Experimental results confirm the system's readiness for real-world deployment, with acceptable performance across varying environmental conditions and robust operation in challenging scenarios. The identified limitations and proposed future work provide a clear roadmap for continued improvement and extension of capabilities.

By leveraging existing CCTV infrastructure and employing efficient deep learning models, our system offers a cost-effective approach to traffic violation detection that can be scaled from individual intersections to city-wide deployments. The alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) underscores the broader societal benefits of this work.

In conclusion, automated traffic violation detection represents a critical component of smart city initiatives, contributing to safer roads, more efficient resource allocation, and improved quality of life. Our system demonstrates that current technologies can deliver reliable, real-time detection with high accuracy, providing a valuable tool for urban traffic management while establishing a foundation for future advances in this domain.
