**Problem Statement and Objective**

### Problem Statement
Manual requirement engineering is a time-consuming and expensive process, consuming approximately 40% of project budgets. Traditional methods often lead to inefficiencies, ambiguity in requirement specifications, and compliance issues. Organizations struggle to ensure accuracy, traceability, and standardization, leading to delays and increased costs. The need for an automated solution that streamlines requirement gathering and documentation is critical.

### Project Objective

- Reduce the time and cost associated with manual requirement engineering.
- Improve compliance with industry standards by 87%.
- Deliver an efficient, scalable, and deployable solution within 24 hours.
- Ensure requirement traceability and validation through AI-driven pattern recognition and quality checks.

**Methodology**
1. **Cloud-Native Core Implementation:**
   - Deploy using Docker containers for instant scalability.
   - Ensure offline capability for demonstration reliability.
   
2. **AI-Powered Requirement Analysis:**
   - Utilize pattern recognition to categorize requirements.
   - Implement NLP models to enhance accuracy and completeness.
   
3. **Multimodal Input Processing:**
   - Support inputs from text, images, and speech.
   - Integrate Google Vision API and Whisper for input transformation.
   
4. **Regulatory Intelligence & Compliance:**
   - Pre-loaded compliance templates for common industry standards.
   - Automatic formatting and validation of requirements.
   
5. **Event-Driven Architecture:**
   - Streamline data processing using an efficient pipeline.
   - Ensure real-time requirement generation and updates.
